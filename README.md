## Why an app like this ## 

Main goal of this application is to create user-friendly work environment for experts to read and store standarized data about subjects of protection in Natura 2000 Sites of European Union. It's also a good challenge wchch will improve my coding skills.

Few things need to t obe explained about this database scheme.
Few months ago I wrote in collaboration with my colleagues from Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Wroc≈Çaw a standard to collect spatial data for Plans of Protective Actions on Natura 2000 sites [link to it in this repository](https://github.com/kieemi/environment-database-app/blob/master/Standard%20to%20collect%20spatial%20data%20for%20Plans%20of%20Protective%20Actions%20on%20Natura%202000%20sites%20(polish%20version).zip) . Data format to collect data is ESRI Shapefile, which is about 20 years old, but widely used even nowadays. Data description for shapefiles are stored in Data Base Files (.dbf), in which data columns names can't be longer than 10 characters. That's why column names in database are so short (beside key columns). But by this, we can directly copy data from shapefiles to postgis and export it from postgis to shapefiles using any GIS program. Column names have their full names in Java code, so I won't make comment descriptions in english SQL DDL, at least for now.

Other thing, that might seem a mistake in database modeling is redundant guid_ column in multiple tables. It's used deliberately as an "aditional global unique key" to create 1-1 and 1-N relations beetwen tables, so data can be edited and vieved in GIS programs without direct connection to database, just by using shapefile and data base files. For interested, click this [link](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/attribute_table.html#creating-one-or-many-to-many-relations), which show it works in QGIS.

## How it works now ## 

At this stage app provide simple view of sample data from database and REST API

## How it will work ## 

I'm aiming to create CRUD web app and REST API to manage nonspatial, standarized part of data in PostGIS database to create table views and reports from it. In future, maybe add some spacial data editing tools.
