Main goal of this application is to create user-friendly work environment for experts to read and store standarized data about subjects of protection in Natura 2000 Sites of European Union.

As a specialist in spatial information systems, a few months ago I wrote in collaboration with my colleagues from Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Wroc≈Çaw a standard to collect spatial data for Plans of Protective Actions on Natura 2000 sites (I will  soon add it to repository files).

But main problem is that experts would rather use simple app to click on that will take them by the hand, rather than read standards and create relations in spatial data by themselves. It's obvious that it will have generate other advantages, but I'll write about them soon.

At this stage I'm aiming to create CRUD web app and REST API to manage nonspatial, standarized part of data in PostGIS database to create table views and reports from it.

That's all for today. I'll expand README file when I add a database scheme and some inserts for database...
